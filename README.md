# Big Data Analysis: Measuring Z Boson Mass from 7.6 Million CERN Proton-Proton Collision Data

A Python-based big data computational physics data analysis project that measures the Z boson mass using ATLAS Open Data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The project demonstrates **large-scale data processing**, **statistical fitting with Cauchy distributions**, and **particle physics analysis** on 550,000 collision events producing 1.1 million rows X 7 columns of data.

**Key Libraries:** `pandas`, `Numpy`, `SciPy` (for curve fitting and statistics), `matplotlib`, `uproot`

## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze ATLAS Open Data from CERN's LHC to **measure the Z boson mass ($m_Z$)** using muon-pair events (Z→μ⁺μ⁻) from 550,000 proton-proton collisions, and compare the determined mass to the PDG value. This was done by:

1. **Data Selection & Filtering:** Applied particle selection criteria to isolate Z boson decay events from background processes
2. **Invariant Mass Reconstruction:** Calculated the invariant mass of muon pairs from kinematic data
3. **Statistical Fitting:** Used Cauchy distributions to model the Z boson mass distribution 
4. **Uncertainty Analysis:** Determined measurement precision and compared with established values

## 📊 Key Results

The experimental value Z-boson mass was determined to be: **$m_Z = 91300 \pm 6.83  \text{MeV}/c^2$**

This represents a significant improvement over initial selection methods, reducing the deviation from PDG value ($91187 \pm 4.13  \text{MeV}/c^2$) from 441.6 MeV/c² to 112.4 MeV/c².

## ⚙️ How It Works: Analysis Pipeline

The analysis is structured in a clear pipeline within the `Codes` directory:

1. **Data Selection & Filtering:** Applied selection criteria to 7.6M collision events
   - Opposite charge muons for Z boson analysis
   - Transverse momentum cuts: $39,990 \text{MeV}/c < p_T < 560,000  \text{MeV}/c$
   - Pseudorapidity range: $0.2 < |η| < 2.20$
   - **Result:** Reduced dataset from 7,689,598 to 1,732,276 entries (77.46% background rejection)

2. **Invariant Mass Reconstruction:** Calculated using the equation $m_{μ^+μ^-} = \sqrt{E^2 - |\vec{p}|^2}$  

3. **Statistical Fitting:** Used Cauchy (Breit-Wigner) distribution to model and determine the Z boson mass distribution:
   
   $$f(E_{\mu^+\mu^-}) \propto \frac{1}{(E_{\mu^+\mu^-} - m_Z)^2 + \left(\frac{\Gamma_Z}{2}\right)^2}$$
